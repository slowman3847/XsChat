# Versions
This is a list of all versions of post-6 XsChat
## Engine 6.2.0
6.2.0 introduces **REAL** AES-256 encryption, for actual security. It is currently in development, along with a nicer UI.
## Engine 6.2.1
6.2.1 is the version shipped with the encryption-less Developer Beta 6 due to internal issues.
## Engine 6.2.2
6.2.2 contains *actual* encryption, no base64 and other things.

Working on for LTS, not main focus.
## Engine 6.2.3
6.2.3 is a lot harder to get easily, without true encryption. This scrambles the text using XORs among other things. It has greater security than pre-6.2 excluding 6.2.2 & 6.2.0-lts builds.
### Why No Encryption?
True encryption would be very difficult to easily pull of, and it also discourages using this product for other larger uses that require security.
